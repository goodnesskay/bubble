                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            ANSWER: Seriously, do you wash your hands without rubbing them together? Do you wash your clothes without agitation? Do you keep your teeth clean by just gargling and mouthwash? Okay you get the point! It is very difficult to get anything really clean without contact. However, at The Luxury Bubbles, we use Micro – Clean Foam and Soft Wash Mitts to gently clean your car. While our soft cloth makes contact with your vehicle, it is the best way to get it clean and will not scratch or dull your clear coat finish.

                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            ANSWER: It is advisable to place an order for your wash about 6hours before the actual wash. This is so we can be able to serve you better. Also, we strongly advice against washing your car during the hot hours of the afternoon as this would leave swirl marks on your paintwork. It is advisable to wash your car early in the morning and late in the evening when the weather is cool.
